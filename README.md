# Project 2-Forum
## Overview
  My project is an open forum where users can talk about anything they want.

  All users can start a topic of their choice - these topics will be displayed in order by how many likes they have.

  Each topic will have comments and every user can leave a new comment and like any comment they want. The comments are also ordered by the amount of likes they get.
